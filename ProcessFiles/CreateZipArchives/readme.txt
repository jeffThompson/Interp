INCLUDED FILES
This zip archive includes four files:

1. [model number].OBJ
This is the main 3d model, which can be opened, manipulated, and remixed using any 3d modeling software. This file is a plain text file (try opening it in Text Edit or Notepad!)

2. [model number].JPG
This is the texture file, which adds the pieces of the original photographs to the 3d model. When loaded, this image is cut up and applied to the surface of the model.

3. [model number].MTL
This file is used to tell your 3d software where to place what part of the texture file. Like the OBJ, this is also just a plain text file.

4. THUMBNAIL.PNG
A reference rendering of the image, at low resolution.

WHAT IS THIS?
INTERP is a series of digital sculptures generated by blending 100 unrelated photographs, placing them into simulated three-dimensional space, and importing them into photogrammetry software, tricking it into thinking the photographs are of a single object.

Every photograph in my library (approximately 12,000 images when the project began in 2012) were used as the input data set. In much of my work, I am interested in "useless" and culturally-derived data sets, so rather than use an arbitrary archive of photographs (a Google image search for a particular term, for example), it seemed more natural to use a finite set that I had generated.
