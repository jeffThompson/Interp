INTERP
====================

**INTERP** is a series of digital sculptures generated by blending 100 unrelated photographs, placing them into simulated three-dimensional space, and importing them into photogrammetry software, tricking it into thinking the photographs are of a single object.

Every photograph in my library (approximately 12,000 images when the project began in 2012) were used as the input data set. In much of my work, I am interested in "useless" and culturally-derived data sets, so rather than use an arbitrary archive of photographs (a Google image search for a particular term, for example), it seemed more natural to use a finite set that I had generated.
