INTERP
====================

**INTERP** is a series of digital sculptures generated by blending 100 unrelated photographs, placing them into simulated three-dimensional space, and importing them into photogrammetry software, tricking it into thinking the photographs are of a single object.

Every photograph in my library (approximately 12,000 images when the project began in 2012) were used as the input data set. In much of my work, I am interested in "useless" and culturally-derived data sets, so rather than use an arbitrary archive of photographs (a Google image search for a particular term, for example), it seemed more natural to use a finite set that I had generated.

WHAT'S HERE
-----------
This repository includes a lot of process files and misc scripts.

* **Documentation And Screenshots**  
Various images of the project along the way (including some interesting glitches)
* **Early Versions**  
An early beta version of the site, kept mostly for my archival purposes
* **Full Res Renders - Uncropped**  
High-resolution renders of each model from Blender (not cropped)
* **Interp Website**  
The main repo with the production version of the site
* **Notes And Ideas**  
An ongoing file with process, notes, and to do lists
* **Process Files**  
Lots of random scripts and related files for file processing, cleanup, etc

*The full-res model files are not included in this repo because they total about 7GB. If you're interested in getting some of these files, please let me know.*
